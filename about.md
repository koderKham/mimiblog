Sha-Hello Ladies!!!!

First off, I think its fair to say that I am everything short of a hair guru lol... but I am a recent graduate of the University of Florida. I am 27 years old and I currently reside in Florida. You will get to know alot about my interests through this blog and you'll have details about my hair journey progress. I will try to blog as often as possible, we all live a busy lifestyle in one way or another but I will but forth great effort in updating this blog as much as possible! 

Yes, I am on a hair journey...I'm learning what works for me and what doesn't. I've taken on the product junkie role which has become one of the downsides of my journey BUT that's a plus for you because I'll be able to give you product reviews :).

A little disclaimer about my blog is that not everyone will feel the same way as I do or follow the same regimen...that is totally fine. What I write on this blog is completely based on my experience; so you can pick and choose the advice that you want to add in your reggie. :) I would love for you to add to this blog....let me know things that have worked for you; as I said before I am learning and experimenting just like you! <3

For all inquiries please feel free to contact me at shamekeyiad@gmail.com!

Toodles dolls!
